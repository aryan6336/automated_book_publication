Here's a rewritten version of Chapter 1 in a modern, engaging, and concise style:

**The Gates of Morning**

**Chapter 1: The Canoe Builder**

Dick stood on the edge of the coral ledge, gazing out at the South. Behind him, the outer sea thundered with waves, while before him lay the calm lagoon of Karolin, a sea within itself, infinite and blue. His eyes scanned the horizon, taking in the sight of his people – women, children, youths, all busy along the beach, fishing, playing games, or working on their canoes.

Dick's gaze fell upon the empty houses where war canoes once rested on rollers. His thoughts turned to the past, and the memories that lingered like a fog in his mind. He was lost in thought when Little Tari, the son of Le Taioi, the net maker, approached him.

Tari looked up at Dick with wide eyes, asking a question he couldn't quite understand – "Taori, who are you?" The child's simplicity was infectious, and for a moment, Dick forgot about his complicated past. He introduced himself as Taori, a stranger from far away, sent by the gods to be their chief and leader.

But as he spoke, memories began to resurface, and Dick's mind grew cloudy once more. He struggled to find the right words, leaving out parts of his story that would make no sense to Tari. The child's question had stirred something within him, though – a memory of his time on Palm Tree, an island 50 miles north, where he'd grown up with Kearney, a sailor who taught him how to fish and build canoes.

As Dick gazed out at the lagoon, he saw Katafa, the girl who'd been blown away from Karolin by a storm. He remembered their life together on Palm Tree, and how they'd escaped from men who'd destroyed their home with violence and fire. The memory of those events still lingered in his mind, fueling a sense of unease.

As he stood there, lost in thought, Katafa appeared beside him, her dark hair escaping the elastic vine that bound it. Her eyes were fixed on something beyond the horizon – Palm Tree, visible for the first time since their arrival in Karolin. The island was shrouded in mist, but as they watched, it began to take shape, like a mirage.

Katafa pointed out at sea, and Dick followed her gaze. In the distance, he saw canoes approaching from the southern beach – the ones he'd sent for the canoe builders. His mind turned to war, and the thought of these men building their own canoes, just as Karolin's people did. He wondered if they'd come in peace or with intent to cause harm.

As the canoes drew closer, Dick's anxiety grew. He knew that Katafa was a threat to them, a source of danger in their midst. His heart pounded faster, and his eyes narrowed into slits as he watched the approaching canoes.

The vision of Palm Tree began to fade, but its presence lingered in Dick's mind. He saw himself standing on the beach, surrounded by warriors from Melanesia, men who'd burned ships and killed without mercy. The memory filled him with a deep-seated hatred for these invaders, and he knew that they'd come for Karolin.

And so, as Katafa turned to face him, her eyes locked onto his, Dick's mind was consumed by a single thought – these men would come, and when they did, war would erupt. The gates of morning had opened, revealing a world of danger and uncertainty.
